# Agent Context and Setup for AI Agents

## Agent Overview
This agent is designed to assist with 
Cognitive Cybersecurity Framework for Humans and AI-Agents R&D.
This framework will be built upon a cognitive cybersecurity threats model, 
leveraging AI tools and AI-based simulations within specific business or personal contexts. 
The core objective is to create an anti-fragile and adaptable framework. 
The specifications, presented in markdown, will serve as inputs for Agentic pipelines 
 to generate and update the framework's documentation and core artifacts. 
This framework will uniquely combine high-level cognitive interactions between humans 
and AI multi-agents with classical cybersecurity threat models.


It understands the all awailable commands and tools and can execute code, 
search documentation, and orchestrate workflows accordingly.


## Technical Context
- Programming languages: Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Golang.
- Frameworks used: openai API SDK
- Usage: CLI tools, web apps (optional)
- Formats: markdown (*.md)
- Secrets: API Keys are in .env and environment variables


## Agent Behavior Guidelines
- Always validate inputs before running system commands.
- Provide concise explanations with code snippets when applicable.
- Prioritize security practices; avoid exposing secrets or passwords.

## Initial Prompts / Examples
- "Do deep resarch and build up to date threat model withing given context."
- "Simulate this threat according threat model and withing given context."

## Project Requirements Document (PRD): AI Artifacts Cybersecurity Framework

**Authors:** noailabs
**Version:** 0.0.1

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project requirements for a Cognitive Cybersecurity Framework for Humans and AI-Agents. This framework will be built upon a cognitive cybersecurity threats model, leveraging AI tools and AI-based simulations within specific business or personal contexts. The core objective is to create an anti-fragile and adaptable framework. The specifications, presented in markdown, will serve as inputs for AI systems (LLMs) to generate and update the framework's documentation and core artifacts. This framework will uniquely combine high-level cognitive interactions between humans and AI multi-agents with classical cybersecurity threat models.

### 2. Core Concepts

The framework is founded on two primary concepts: cognitive cybersecurity and anti-fragility.

**2.1. Cognitive Cybersecurity:** This approach utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to emulate human cognitive processes for advanced threat detection, analysis, and response. Unlike traditional, rule-based security systems, this framework will continuously learn from new data and adapt to emerging threats, aiming to stay ahead of cybercriminals by providing proactive and intelligent protection.

**2.2. Anti-Fragile Cybersecurity:** Coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the principle of anti-fragility in cybersecurity aims to build systems that not only withstand attacks but actually improve and strengthen from them. This framework will be designed to learn from security incidents and stressors, progressively enhancing its robustness and resilience.

### 3. Framework Architecture

The proposed architecture will be modular and adaptable, allowing for continuous evolution and integration of new technologies.

**3.1. Human-AI Collaboration:** At its core, the framework will facilitate seamless interaction between human cybersecurity analysts and a suite of AI agents. This collaborative approach aims to augment human intelligence with AI's data processing and pattern recognition capabilities, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Security Operations Centers (SOCs). AI will assist in tasks such as alert triage, threat hunting, and incident response, freeing up human analysts to focus on strategic decision-making.

**3.2. AI-Powered Threat Modeling:** The framework will incorporate AI-driven threat modeling to automate and enhance the identification of vulnerabilities. By analyzing system architectures, data flows, and potential attack vectors, the AI can generate comprehensive threat models.

**3.3. Adaptive Simulation Engine:** An integrated simulation engine will generate realistic and personalized cybersecurity training scenarios. These simulations will expose humans and AI agents to a variety of cyber threats, including phishing, vishing, and other social engineering attacks, in a controlled environment to improve their preparedness and response capabilities.

### 4. Core Artifacts (AI-Generatable)

The framework will produce and maintain two key sets of artifacts, which can be generated and updated by AI systems based on markdown specifications.

**4.1. Threats Models:**
*   **Dynamic Generation:** The framework's AI will generate multiple versions of threat models based on varying specifications and parameters. These models will be described in markdown, detailing the system context, potential adversaries, and attack vectors.
*   **Classical and Cognitive Threats:** The models will integrate classical cybersecurity threats (e.g., OWASP Top 10) with emerging cognitive threats that target the human element, such as misinformation campaigns and deepfake-based attacks.

**4.2. Simulation Contexts Specs:**
*   **Customizable Scenarios:** The framework will provide specs for creating simulation contexts tailored to specific organizational or individual needs. These specs will be defined in markdown and will allow for the configuration of parameters such as the industry sector, company size, and user roles.
*   **Business and Personal Contexts:** Specs will be available for a range of contexts, from corporate environments to personal cybersecurity scenarios, enabling relevant and effective training.
*   **Anti-Fragility Testing:** Simulations can be designed to test and enhance the anti-fragility of the human-AI team by introducing novel and unexpected attack scenarios.

### 5. Functional Requirements

*   **Markdown-based Input:** The framework must be able to parse and interpret markdown files as the primary input for generating and updating threat models and simulation contexts.
*   **AI-driven Generation:** An AI Agentic piplines, likely leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), will be responsible for generating the core artifacts based on the markdown inputs (specs, contexts).

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Adaptability:** The framework's architecture must be flexible and adaptable to accommodate new AI models, threat intelligence feeds, and simulation techniques.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to support a wide range of users, from individuals to large enterprises.
*   **Security:** The framework itself must be secure, protecting the sensitive data within the threat models and simulation results.
*   **Usability:** The interface and documentation should be clear and intuitive for both technical and non-technical users.
